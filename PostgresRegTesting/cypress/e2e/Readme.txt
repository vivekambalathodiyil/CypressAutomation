This code is for SQL Version
Projects:
 We can either copy one project or create a new folder and then add cypress via npm.
base URL
 URL is setup in C:\Users\vivek.ambalathodiyil\CypressAutomation\Schoen SQL\cypress.config.js
 if we want to use this script in other URL we have to change the url in cypress.config.js
Custom Commands
 This is set up in C:\Users\vivek.ambalathodiyil\CypressAutomation\Schoen SQL\cypress\support\commands.js
 There are 2 logins one for Admin(cy.loginAdmin()) & one for manager(cy.loginManager())
 We can just change the username and passwords in each section to replace users.
 Plugins
  Not all the added plugins are required, as the project is copied the plugins are also added which 
  were used in other projects.
